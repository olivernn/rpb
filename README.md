##Â Installation

### Local (OS X) Host

The provided `pbserve` command will connect to your remote host and forward connections to the local `pbcopy` and `pbserve` builtins.

By default the current user will be used to access the remote machine, this can be changed using the `--user` switch

    $ pbserve --host remote.host.name --user bob
